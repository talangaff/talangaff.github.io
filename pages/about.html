                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm Talan Gaff. I was born on June 8, 2006 in Indiana, where I lived for around 10 years.
                    I was nervous to move to Tennessee, leaving behind all of my friends and family. I have now lived
                    in East Tennessee for almost 9 years and I still love it.
                </p>
                <p>My interest in programming began at a rather young age when I first found out about <a href="https://www.scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.
                    Scratch is where I learned the fundamentals of programming and how certain things worked. The ease of simply
                    dragging and dropping code snippets together made it easy for me to learn, understand, and enjoy the basics of programming.
                    Although I have never completed a full game on Scratch, it has taught me many valuable programming lessons and it is
                    where my desire to develop first started.
                </p>
                <p>I am very happy to be in the place that I am today. Of course I have had some struggles in my life,
                    but without the problems I would not be where I am today. My family was affected by the wildfires in
                     Gatlinburg of 2016. These fires completely destroyed our house and everything we owned. This caused a
                     major setback on our lives because nearly everything we had was gone. This issue caused my family a 
                    lot of stress and problems, but we were able to find a place to stay while we rebuilt our house. Although
                    this situation was very devastating for my family and many others, we have thankfully been able to overcome
                    the challenge that came our way.

                <p>I graduated High School in 2024. I am now attending Walters-State Community College along with Bethel School of Technology.
                    I am pursuing a degree in programming in hopes of one day becoming a full time software developer. I also plan to receive my
                    COMPTIA Security+ Certification by the end of June 2025.

                    <h2>Personal Values</h2>
                    <p>Some of my personal values include patience, forgiveness, and respect. I live by these
                        values and they define everything that I do. I also do everything with integrity, ensuring
                        that everything I complete is my own work.
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe that everyone deserves forgiveness and respect. I have adapted this belief from
                        teaching of Jesus. These teachings have taught me that everyone deserves love and respect
                        even when the rest of the world hates them.    
                    <p>
                    <h4>Generative AI</h4>
                    <p>I use generative artificial intelligence as an assistive tool only. This means that I do
                        not use it to complete work that I claim to be my own. Using it as a tool looks more like
                        using it to assist my thought process instead of replacing it. I use it to guide me in
                        the direction I need to go, but I do not use it to complete everything for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using generative AI to complete tasks for me would hinder my learning because I would never
                        learn how to complete things on my own, which is why I have decided to stay away from taking
                        advantage of AI to complete things for me.
